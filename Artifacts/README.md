#California Department of Technology - OnCore Consulting ADPQ Vendor Pool Refresh Prototype - 
###[Prototype URL](Prototype URL)

##Introduction

OnCore’s [Statement of Work]( https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Statement-of-Work) for this RFP is focused on delivering what the end user needs.  Combining an Agile methodology and User Centered design provides an ideal vehicle to quickly understand what users want and delivering functioning, high value features for the business and development teams to incrementally improve on.  Using Agile stories that built up functionality over the sprints, we were able to adjust quickly to the needs of the business as they were able to immediatley see the application and the requirements they were providing.  These tight cycles between ideas and testing allowed us to respond quickly to change and focused on solutions not features.    

In addition to the Agile Team, we had support from the client executive team that enabled the end users we were working with to have the power to make decisions and own the product. This ensured that we would be building and delivering a product that end user wanted and needed with this collaboration. With this level of collaboration, we defined our strategy as 'try, fail fast, learn, and then try again."   

The following documentation represents our demonstration in designing under a User Centered Design methodology, building with modern technologies in an Agile methodology with an adherence to the US Digital Playbook.

##User Centric Design - Understanding what people need  
The first step of a [User-Centered-Design](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/User-Centric-Design) (UCD) process is to formulate a plan.  We developed a [statement of work](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Statement-of-Work) to identify the project objectives, requirements, user community, constraints, schedule, and deliverables.

Our plan combines our UCD and Agile processes into a cohesive and flexible workflow.  It was this combination that we were able to identify the features that the users valued the most, and were able to focus our story and build activities to deliver working functionality after each sprint.  This allowed for feedback and changes to the design and resulted in a product that reflected what the end users were really asking for.

The team utilized User-Centered-Design (UCD) and Agile development techniques to formulate the product backlog.  All team members participated in the initial meetings with the users which was a natural hook into our Agile methodolgy and gave everyone the opportunity to understand the scope of the project and understand how each of them would contribute to the project's success.  

The table below summarizes how we incorporated the UCD practices in the development of CalOrders.  Each section includes a link to another page that provides detail on the subject. _(2d)_

##Agile Prototype Development   

The team's principle focus during development of CalOrders is summarized best by Jeff Sutherland.
 
“[Value] people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what that product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan.” (Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time)

[Oncore's Agile methodology](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Agile-Methodolgy) provided the team an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype_(2j)_.   

###Principles

There are many different specific project development methodologies within agile. but they all center around a core set of principles:

1. Define a measurable goal.
2. Everyone owns the problem.
3. Small steps with visible impact.
4. Validate with your target audience.
5. Measure success.
6. Reflect, adjust, iterate.

###Process   

Our [Agile](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Agile-Methodolgy) process allowed us to rapidly deliver a working product to maintain the momentum from the User Centered Design Sessions, allowing us to show the end user the system we were building. Combined with sprint cycles we were able to add new stories; existing stories in the backlog and icebox were continually evolving and reprioritized with continued meetings outside of the development cycle. These meeting took place between the product owner, business analysts and end users. Focusing on keeping things simple and evolving fostered the environment of rapid delivery and allowed for face to face interactions with the end users on how the system was evolving.  More importanly, it allowed for failure, and with the quick adjustments yieled a system that worked for the end users.

## Development Environment

CalOrders by default uses the open source NetBeans IDE for development.  NetBeans provides excellent Java and JavaScript support as well as an integrated Oracle JET plugin providing command line completion and other useful features when working with Oracle JET. However, NetBeans is not required and Eclipse or IntelliJ can be used to work on the backend JEE components and any editor can be used to edit the user interface code as it is just standard JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. For more information about setting up a local development environment, see the [CalOrders Help](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Help) wiki page.


## Projects

The CalOrders application is separated by area of concern into separate NetBeans projects. 
 
* CalOrdersJET - [(CDT–ADPQ–0117-2-Technical Approach: Client UI)](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersJET)  JET HTML5 project providing the front end for the CalOrders application.
* JavaScript Library - [(CDT–ADPQ–0117-2-Technical Approach: JavaScript Library)](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/index.html) Orcle JET is an open source JavaScript framework proving a rich set of ADA compliant components. See User Interface section below for more details about Oracle JET
* CalOrdersREST - [(CDT–ADPQ–0117-2-Technical Approach: REST Service)](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersRest) Java dynamic web project providing support for REST services and the data access layer via Java JEE (Java Enterprise Edition) and JPA (Java Persistence API)
* CalOrdersCore - Java API project holding shared utility classes, interfaces, and base classes designed to support the other CalOrders Java projects.  
* CalOrders Database = [(CDT–ADPQ–0117-2-Technical Approach: Database)](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/DB_Scripts) MySQL database model, DDL, and reference data scripts.



## User Interface

The CalOrders user interface layer [(CDT–ADPQ–0117-2-Technical Approach: Client UI)](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersJET) is comprised of the open source Oracle JET JavaScript framework. From the Oracle JET user guide, "Oracle JET is a collection of Oracle and open source JavaScript libraries engineered to make it as simple and efficient as possible to build client-side web and hybrid mobile applications based on JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS.

Oracle JET is designed to meet the following application needs:

* Add interactivity to an existing page.
* Create a new end-to-end client-side web application using JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, and best practices for responsive design.
* Create a hybrid mobile application that looks and feels like a native iOS, Android or Windows application.

Unlike many competing open source JavaScript alternatives, Oracle JET has an excellent and complete [component](http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/jet/jetCookbook.html) library covering all aspects of user interface construction. In addition, it has a rich set of documentation and a complete and fully documented API.  Oracle JET forms the basis for Oracle's own product lines and is therefore updated and enhanced on a regular basis. 

JET also covers the following critical areas of modern web user interface construction:

* Full W3C ADA compliance
* Security features as outlined in the OWASP guidelines
* Strict adherence to MVC standards for clean separation of concerns
* Full internationalization support
* Responsive design
* Theme support 
* Mobile hybrid support
* Support for SPA (Single Page Application) design ( see [Single Page Application - WikiPedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single-page_application) ) Note, CalOrders is a SPA application.

Due to these features and its extensive component library, JET provides an excellent foundation for the CalOrders UI. For more information about the Oracle JET framework please see [About Oracle JET](http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet220/jet/developer/GUID-C6947139-DF37-4258-8E02-2679F40535E1.htm#JETDG108)

### SPA (Single Page Application)

CalOrders is a Single Page Application, having a single entry point, index.html.  Each screen in the application is a distinct HTML fragment substituted by the JET routing framework, however, they are not full HTML pages.  

### Views

A [view](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersJET/src/js/views) in CalOrders is a distinct SPA HTML fragment, which holds the front end visual static content and components for the view. JET uses Knockout for data binding, which binds the view model to the view.  


### View Models

A [view model](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersJET/src/js/viewModels) holds the business logic for the view and also manages the REST operations for the view.  The view model uses a consistent pattern defined by JET, which helps to ensure consistency across models and simplifies coding.

## Services

![Figure 6](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/blob/master/Artifacts/images/Architecture_files/calorders_arch03.jpg)

Figure 6: CalOrders Service Architecture

CalOrders uses [REST services](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/tree/master/CalOrdersRest/src/java/com/oncore/calorders/rest/service) exposed from JEE Session Beans using the built in annotations available from Java.  Java provides excellent REST service support in JEE making it extremely easy to create REST services supporting CRUD operations on an underlying datastore.  CalOrders uses the NetBeans REST services generator to create the core set of JPA entities and REST facades needed for the application.  Customizing the service entities is supported via built in JPA functionality using the persistence.xml file and xml files containing custom named queries or custom queries can be defined directly in the REST Facades using the JPA create query method and syntax.  See the [HOW TO Create Custom Queries and REST Facades](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/HOW-TO-Create-Custom-Queries-and-REST-Facades) Wiki page for more details on how to create custom JPA Named Queries and REST Facades.  Core classes and utilities needed to support the underlying architecture across domains are defined in CalOrdersCore, which is addressed later in this document.


## Shared Architectural Components

As CalOrders places common architectural components in the shared CalOrdersCore project. CalOrdersCore only contains base classes and interfaces, and shared utility classes.  NetBeans simplifies compilation and deployment by allowing other NetBeans projects such as CalOrdersREST to reference core in the editor. The option is also available to compile and bundle the CalOrdersCore project into an independent Jar, which can then be referenced by other projects. 

## Databases

The CalOrders application currently uses the MySQL database for back-end storage. However, as CalOrders uses JPA as an abstraction layer, there is nothing preventing migrating the database to a different provider such as Oracle or SQL Server. JPA provides CalOrders impressive flexibility and upgradability in this regard.

The CalOrdersREST project contains a dedicated folder to hold the MySQL DDL, database model, reference, and test data insert scripts as seen in Figure 7.

![database folders](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/blob/master/Artifacts/images/Architecture_files/folders.png)

Figure 7: Database Folders and Files

The database model can be viewed and updated by using the MySQL Workbench tool.  Please see the [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com) website for more information about MySQL and to obtain the database and WorkBench tools for your operating system.

## Accessibility

Please see the [Accessibility](http://docs.oracle.com/middleware/jet220/jet/developer/GUID-A8970DC0-7935-46B8-9A55-BCF4380B2CFC.htm#JETDG253) section of the Oracle JET Development Guide. As part of the quality control process for CalOrders, ADA testing via the WAVE plugin and the NVDA screen reader are used to ensure pages are accessible.
