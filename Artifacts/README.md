##Technical Approach _(2)_
Oncore’s principle focus during development of CalOrders is summarized best by Jeff Sutherland.
 
“[Value] people over processes; products that actually work over documenting what that product is supposed to do; collaborating with customers over negotiating with them; and responding to change over following a plan.” (Scrum: The Art of Doing Twice the Work in Half the Time)

Oncore focused on delivering what the end user needed. This was done with a combination of user research, rapid prototyping, and constant interaction with end users through interviews and focus groups. These tight cycles between ideas and testing allowed us to respond quickly to change. Focusing on solutions not features and adhering to the [U.S. Digital Services](https://playbook.cio.gov/) Playbook promoted user satisfaction and adoption through continuous interaction/feedback. We [followed](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Addressing-U.S.-Digital-Services-Playbook-Plays) all of the applicable Playbook plays.

##User Centric Design - Understanding what people need  
The first step of a User-Centered-Design (UCD) process is to formulate a plan.  We developed a (statement of work)[https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Statement-of-Work] to document the project objectives, requirements, user community, constraints, schedule, and deliverables.

The plan that was developed combines our UCD and Agile process into a streamline process that is included in the following image.

![Agile and UCD Processes](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/blob/master/Artifacts/images/agile/UCD%20and%20Agile%20Process%20Flow.jpg)

Oncore utilized User-Centered-Design (UCD) techniques to formulate the product backlog.  All team members were part of the initial meetings with the users, this was a natural hook to our Agile methodolgy and gave everyone owns the problem.   Below summarizes how we incorporated the “Analyze, Design/Implement, Test and Refine” UCD practices in the development of CalOrders. _(2d)_  

We worked Naga and Cindy from the Department of General Services, and Department of Technolgy respectively.  Both are seasoned adminstrators of the procurement process.  We focused on understanding the business functions that they did most frequently, and also listened to them describe how they did their work in their existing systems.  Walking through a day in life scenarios of both the end users and the administrators provided us the detail the team needed to build and prioritize the features for the new system allowed us to all agree on the outcome, and define our roadmap to get to deliver.

//tentative wording, we can pull it later
We used the following components of UCD to capture what users wanted.  Combined with the UCD methodolgy, our Agile Delivery allowed Naga and Cindy to also see what the development team was producing.  We took a similar approach that we learned from a brigade session with Code For America, where we worked with the Department to allow Cindy and Naga to execute their daily tasks concurrently in the old system and CalOrders.  Although CalOrders is not live, it allowed for real life testing of the application, and allowed for feedback and affermation that we were delivering what they really asked for.

##Agile Prototype Development   

Following [Agile](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Agile-Methodolgy), provided the team an iterative approach, where feedback informed subsequent work or versions of the prototype_(2j)_.   


###Principles

There are many different specific project development methodologies within agile. but they all center around a core set of principles:

1. Define a measurable goal.
2. Everyone owns the problem.
3. Small steps with visible impact.
4. Validate with your target audience.
5. Measure success.
6. Reflect, adjust, iterate.

###Process   

Our [Agile](https://github.com/OncoreLLC/CalOrders/wiki/Agile-Methodolgy) process allowed us to rapidly deliver a working product to maintain the momentum from the User Centered Design Sessions, allowing us to show the und user the system we were building. Combined with sprint cycles we were able to add new stories; existing stories in the backlog and icebox were continually evolving and reprioritized with continued meetings outside of the development cycle. These meeting took place between the product owner, business analysts and end users. Focusing on keeping things simple and evolving fostered the environment of rapid delivery and allowed for face to face interactions with the end users on how the system was evolving.  More importanly, it allowed for failure, and with the quick adjustments yieled a system that worked for the end users.
